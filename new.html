            When it comes to objects the sun is one of my most favorite things that make us feel small. 
            Smaller than we actually are. Not just because my name means the star we are taking over 365 days
            to orbit but the fact that it's very existence manipulated our minds in a mass level that we had
            to believe we are only alive because everything is, thankfully, perfect. I wonder before Tefnut 
            brought the eye to Ra, how did mankind take him as a god, the most significant one who were to inherit 
            the knowledge o Khepera, how small they felt standing before someone with an empty fist only filled with 
            secrets? Or did Copernicus see something more than truth while going against everyone just to tell the star 
            is not moving, we instead are? If the truth was really worth it then why are we here? Stranded in the 
            middle of a mess cuffed by our own imagination? What went wrong? Who took over the throne of legitimacy? 
            Will knowing that even help? Or its just another leap for us to wake up another day and remember to breathe? 
            Idk what gets me at this hours. Nothing logical clearly. I dont feel drunk or tired or sleepy, nothing. 
            Thats the problem, I feel nothing..... We feel nothing these days </p>
